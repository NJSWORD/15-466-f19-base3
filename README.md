This is a very big maze!
(It was very big. I built 10 cameras and a 150 * 150 garden with so many trees. But I found my blend file is too large, like 100MB. The script will run more than two hours to produce a new pnct file. So I cut the size to 30MB and the maze is not so big anymore.)
You need to find a way out!
